whoami - displays your local username

Version Control

GITHUB

doesn't work sometimes --> git remote set-url origin https://github.com/TheDenizSumer/TechInnovationProject.git    - this makes the local repostory that was made earlier into a remote one by connecting it to the github website

git remote add origin https://github.com/TheDenizSumer/TechInnovationProject.git
git remote rm origin - removes

git push origin master


git pull url - is much better

git clone url - this clone the github project into your dir

git clone -b <branch> <url> - this clones a specific directory of the github project into your dir
