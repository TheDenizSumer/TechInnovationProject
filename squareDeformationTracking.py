#Masking to seperate the place makers from the backrouind

#centroid tracking to find the placemakers withing the pixel coordinates of the image. Placemakers must not be too large in order to not interfere with the digital image tracking of the overall software

# list of coordinates of the centroids to see if the program can track relaibaly throught the entirity of a video

# start the process of appliying concepts of strain and other things to make sure that the overall concept isn't flawed if it is make sure that there sia  developed plan ready to deploy asap

# once we can determine that the square tracking works, apply square tracking to the list of coordinates of the centroids
